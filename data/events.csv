Texas Working Families Party took a look at the numbers from the 2017 municipal election and saw that overwhelmingly, Millennial voters did not turn out. We’d guess, that most Millennials didn’t know that they had missed the chance to vote. **We don’t want this to happen again in 2019.**

### Texas WFP believes local people should be represented in local government, but unfortunately, that’s not what we’re seeing. 

### So what is Our Turn?

Our Turn Texas is the Texas Working Families Party’s Big Bold Idea to get a few more young Texans involved in local politics. Municipal elections aren’t sexy. There aren’t rock star candidates with celebrity endorsements. But what’s at stake are every day issues that affect all of us and last time, only 1% of Millennial voters showed up.

And if you join me in New Hampshire this weekend, we can prove that good ol’ grassroots organizing is the most effective way to reach voters and achieve the big, structural change that we need.

Since I’ve arrived in New Hampshire, I’ve had meaningful conversations with people all over this state.

I talked to a man who said he lost his home and life savings during the 2008 economic crisis. A young mother who struggles to pay for child care. And a recent college grad who worries if she’ll ever be able to pay off her student loans.

By just listening to fellow working people and sharing how Elizabeth Warren’s vision for America will make a marked difference in their lives, I’ve been able to reach a ton of people. And, let me tell you — nothing beats the thrill of knocking on a door and getting a whole family to commit to Elizabeth Warren!

She ran an incredible campaign focused on rooting out corruption, fighting for a government and an economy that works for all of us, and that was accountable to all of our communities.

But while Elizabeth’s campaign has ended, she understood the fight for big, structural change requires us to elect progressives up and down the ballot. Please join us for an organizing call where we will hold space to share what Elizabeth’s campaign meant to all of us, and discuss upcoming races where you can plug in and keep fighting. 

While Elizabeth didn’t make it to the White House, she knows we need to elect movement progressives at every level of government That’s why even while running for president, Elizabeth took the time to endorse progressives running for city, state, and federal office -- including Kendra Brooks, a Philly City Council Member who was elected on the Working Families Party ballot line. 

Kendra ran an insurgent campaign focused on restorative justice, affordable housing, and ending homelessness, and is already making huge strides in her fight for working families on the council since her historic, upset election. 

**The Working Families Party is focused on recruiting, training, and electing progressive candidates like Kendra Brooks up-and-down the ballot and across the country. And your continued commitment to the fight is sorely needed now, more than ever.** 

**So please join our organizing call, Saturday, March 7th at 8:30pm ET/5:30pm PT, and keep this movement going.**"

> “She’s representing the same wave of leadership we saw take the House in 2018 and do it unapologetically,” said Nelini Stamp, national strategy director for the Working Families Party. “She’s representing the next generation of people that are the wave of leadership that brought you the Squad, the next generation of youth leaders that are being unapologetic about the issues.”

[read more about this endorsement here](https://prospect.org/politics/progressive-challenger-in-ohio-earns-working-families-party-endorsement/)

Morgan spent the first nine months of her life in a foster home until she was adopted by a public school teacher and raised on the east side of Columbus, Ohio. She received financial aid to attend a college prep school, which opened her eyes to the economic segregation at play in central Ohio. She went on to earn a B.A. from Tufts University, an M.P.A from Princeton University, and a J.D. from Stanford University. After which, Morgan served as a Senior Adviser to the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and most recently, she served as a VP at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the nation's largest community development organization. Morgan is currently running to represent Ohio's 3rd district in US Congress and is a strong believer in policies that support financial stability, racial justice, stable housing, and a clean environment. 

If you're ready to help bring change to Congress and OH-3, then join in the effort to text voters, learn more about what issues matter to them and their families, and make sure we get out the word about progressive champion, Morgan Harper!"

Taking our supporter pledge means you align with our values and when election time comes you look for WFP endorsed candidates whether they are running on the WFP line or the democratic line. Even if you can’t vote, you can talk up our candidates to everyone you know. Take the pledge at  [www.wfpus.org/pledge](https://wfpus.org/pledge)
